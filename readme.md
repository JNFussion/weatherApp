# Weather App

This project is from [The odin project's JavaScript course.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app)

The objective of the project is to practise the use of asynchronous functions and the use of APIs. <br>
The homepage is a list of button with different cities and a form asking for a city. If you type the name of a city the web will fetch a json file with a list of available cities, then will fetch the weather of the matched cities, the weather information is provided by [Open weather API](https://openweathermap.org/). If you click one of the mached cities, it will display a more detailed weather information.
